This is the initial version of the accessory. At the beginning it was an experiment, but it has not ceased to amaze me and I decided to take it partly as an accessory to MCY Downloader, which in the future I will add it to that program.
Note: MCY Radio is now available for android from January 29! more info and download on my website where you can also find the labels with talkback.
